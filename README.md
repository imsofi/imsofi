### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sofi

This is my old handle. To find where I am now, please follow this link: [github.com/soupglasses](https://github.com/soupglasses)

  <summary><b>Why does this account exist?</b></summary>

  [Repojacking](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/millions-of-github-repos-likely-vulnerable-to-repojacking-researchers-say/) is currently a huge issue plauging GitHub, where if you rename an account or organization, a bad actor can reuse your old handle to effectively un-create all redirects to your new account.
  
  For this, I have created this account as a sort of landing page, to beat out any bad actors from attempting a repojack of any of my repositories.
